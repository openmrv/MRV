# Open MRV
Training materials for monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of forests

## Description
*"OpenMRV is a free open-source platform providing access to forest-related MRV-support resources, such as training materials, tool manuals and technical guidance. Country documentation examples of standard operating procedures (SOPs), manuals, and calculations examples are also available. OpenMRV provides practical support resources that countries can use with their existing systems to generate mid or final outputs relevant to achieving set national MRV objectives. OpenMRV serves as a living library where countries can archive and access current and older versions of shared MRV-support resources. OpenMRV has been designed to enable users to connect with other GFOI resources including REDDcompass and the Registry of Tools to support the design and operationalization of Forest Measurement, Reporting and Verification."* (src: https://openmrv.org/web/guest/about)
